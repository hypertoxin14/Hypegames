    <h2>about this site</h2>

    <p>this site was made for me and my friends in school.
        <br> if all goes according to plan we will host a competition each week and post winners somewhere in this website.
        <br>more games will be added and eventually a change log will be implemnted but for now we have the message board.
        <br> i also have a youtube channel with a whole lot of nothing on in it if you want to subscribe (link at the bottom of this page)
        <br>oh and also these games only work with devices that use keyboards so no phones sorry.</p>
